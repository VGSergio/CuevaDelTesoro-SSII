/**
 * Represents a specific implementation of a cave, extending the {@link CaveModel}.
 *
 * <p>This class provides additional functionality for managing monsters, treasures,
 * and players within the cave grid. It also introduces mechanisms to calculate and
 * update perceptions for squares based on their surroundings, allowing dynamic
 * gameplay interactions.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Features</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Tracks the number of monsters, treasures, and players within the cave.</li>
 *   <li>Provides mechanisms to adjust these item counts dynamically.</li>
 *   <li>Calculates and updates square perceptions based on the statuses of neighboring squares.</li>
 *   <li>Allows the cave size to be modified dynamically, with automatic reinitialization of squares and counts.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Usage</h2>
 * <p>Instances of {@code Cave} can be used to represent game maps where items, entities,
 * and player interactions depend on spatial relationships and grid-based logic.</p>
